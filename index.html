After four months three thousand people are dead and hundreds of thousands of others are displaced.  While the violence has subsided, C&ocircte d’Ivoire continues to face serious challenges as it emerges from more than ten years of civil conflict.  &nbsp;&nbsp;

	<b>Phase I:</b> First 6-12 months of the program focused on helping the Ivorian state reestablish its presence and services throughout the country. This included:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;	Equipment drops to media outlets
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;	Open houses with regional and local courthouses to explain legal services; and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;	Town hall meetings informing the population of the government’s return 
<br><br>	<b>Phase II:</b> Year 2 of the program evolved to help people talk to each other within their communities and rebuild community trust and dialogue. This included:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;	Supporting nascent civil society to return as well as support the emergence of more independent, less politicized civil society more cohesive of diverse communities
<br><br>	<b>Phase III:</b> Year 3 of the program worked to get people to talk to each other about sensitive issues. This also included engaging sensitive groups including  ex-combatants, youth, and non-Ivorian communities.

This decade of conflict left the judicial system in ruins, resulting in inadequate work space for magistrates and judicial staff. Since the end of the post-electoral crisis, OTI has been committed to supporting the Ministry of Justice in its efforts to more firmly establish the rule of law in C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire. In collaboration with Ivorian authorities, USAID has supported efforts to improve working conditions in the courts thereby increasing citizen access.  The rehabilitation, expansion and re-equipment of six damaged and looted judicial facilities is a major step.  These projects have provided the judiciary with new office space, meeting rooms, and modern equipment. At the opening of the new Bouak&eacute; facility, the Ivorian Minister of Justice exclaimed "Gone are the days when we had two, even three magistrates in one office, no more heat or outdated equipment...Welcome to quality work". He emphasized that the "donation is to be understood as a call for an extra effort to make our justice system more credible and favor the reconciliation between the justice system and the population."</p>

To restore citizens' confidence in the educational system, the Ministry of Education declared the fight against corruption its top priority for the 2012-2013 school year. OTI supported this initiative to restore public confidence by helping the Bouak&eacute; office for national education establish an effective corruption reporting system. OTI's support helped stakeholders create a monitoring committee, comprising  Ministry of Education officials, inspectors, principals, teachers, parents and members of civil society, and design a strategy to ensure the sustainability of an anti-corruption mechanism. </p>

A lack of access to the government registration system continues to keep official registration numbers low, resulting in an ongoing lack of access to services, including health care and education, and feelings of exclusion.  To address this problem, OTI supported registration centers in the Gb&ecirc;k&ecirc; region with equipment and training to increase community access to registration services and through a mobile registration campaign.  Additional training was also provided to civil society to encourage registration, explain requirements, and to clarify individual and parental responsibilities.   As a result of these efforts, other regions and prefects are looking to Gb&ecirc;k&ecirc; and Bouak&eacute; as an example of how to improve registration services and better serve their communities.</p>

After tabulating and analyzing the results, the youths presented the findings to a gathering of their peers, community elders, and city authorities. One participant commented that "the elders and other members of our communities reached out to us to praise us for our work.  It feels like we matter to our communities now, that we are part of the rebuilding process and that is a good feeling,"</p>

A history of corruption and dysfunction, as well as misconceptions of the role of the judiciary, has discouraged many Ivorians from trusting the resolution of local conflicts to the formal justice system.  Instead, grievances are more likely to be settled in parallel and less-impartial customary courts. Women, in particular, frequently complain of inequities in the treatment of complaints over rights of inheritance or access to land when brought before customary courts. The focus of the exchange was on how the judiciary works and the services available to communities through the court and its staff but the court staff also offered free legal consultations in partnership with local community advocacy groups.  These open houses helped the community understand and access judicial institutions and were an important steps towards ensuring the delivery of transparent and equitable justice.</p>

More than 300 women traders gathered at the city hall to seek out information about and submit applications for loans. One loan recipient, Bintou Ciss&eacute;, a widow and mother of five, is a prime example of the impact of this support. With a $1,000 USD loan, she started to expand her business of dyeing and selling traditional fabric. Already her income has doubled to $160 per month.  She is reinvesting her extra income in her business and states she can now envision sending all of her children to school. "This open house has been a blessing for us; I had a completely different mindset and would have never even thought of going to a microfinance institution to ask for loans. Today, I am earning more money and I was able to hire one more woman to help... I will send the rest of my children to school next year if God wills" she said.  </p>

Abobo, the most populous commune in Abidja, was particularly effected, causing an increase in poverty and youth unemployment. In an effort to prevent political violence during 2013 municipal elections, OTI supported a program of education, training, and outreach for youth in the community. The four-day event trained 50 youth from various ethnic backgrounds on how to identify and combat negative campaigning techniques and provided them with a better understanding of the civic responsibilities.  Following the training, the youth canvassed Abobo's neighborhoods to engage their communities. The youth distributed nearly 300 leaflets on the code of conduct and led a three week outreach program prior to the elections. This resulted in no reported violence in Abodo during these elections.</p>

 <p class="lead"; style="font-size: 24px; text-align: left;">	Since 1990 elections have been major sources of instability and violence in C&ocirc;te d’Ivoire. The Presidential elections in 2015 could emerge as an incendiary flashpoint, bringing to the fore unresolved issues such as nationality/citizenship, ethnicity, land tenure and impunity that were at the heart of the crisis and remain impediments to a successful post transition period. There is concern that these issues could be exploited particularly at the community level to disrupt and undermine the elections process and gains made during the recovery period as well as impede progress towards consolidating and achieving additional political and economic reforms. </p>
